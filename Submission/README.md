# ds_module_2_VBA_Scripting
HW 2 VBA for Data Science Bootcamp

In this homework, I attempted to write VBA code to analyze provided stock market data.

I created script to loop through all the provided stocks for several quarters to break 3 months of data down into smaller, more usable chunks by highlighting the Ticker code, and showing the Quarterly value change, the percent of that change, and the total tading volume.

To add in the visual story telling of the results, I added some conditional formating, to show quarters with positive growth as green, negative growth as red, and no growth as white.

Further, I attempted to create another leaderboard to show which stock had the Greatest % Increase, the Greatest % Decrease and the Greatest Total Volume per quarter.

Finaly, the VBA code was adjuested to run on every worksheet in the workbook at once.
